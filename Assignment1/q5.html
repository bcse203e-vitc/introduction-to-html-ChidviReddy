There, she is given the chance to explore the outcomes of her regrets in <b><i>different</i></b> realities. Through her journey, she discovers the value of the <b><i>ordinary</i></b> moments and the importance of making <b><i>authentic</i></b> choices. <u>Matt Haig</u> masterfully blends <b><i>philosophical</i></b> reflection with a <b><i>touching</i></b> narrative.
